# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the development server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This application uses both a Next.js server for the frontend and a Genkit server for AI functionality. You'll need to run both in separate terminals.

To start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To start the Genkit development server (in a separate terminal):

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.
